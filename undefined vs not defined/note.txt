The javascript code is executed ina  diffrent ways it create global execution context and allocate memmory to the variables and functions even before a single code executed

var a = 10
Suppose we create a varriable a = 7 even before the line of code exicuted javascript try to allocate memmory to this a memmory space to a even before the line of code run 
the javascript has alredy memmory allocated to the a so we have alredy reserved memmory for a now at this point we try to in the consoler try to log what is a 
it is undefined So why this happends so when it allocates the memmory to all variable and function to the variables it tries to put placeholder it is like placeholder which is placed in the memmory tha special word is undefined 
undefined like taking memmory it is verry deffrent than not defined eg:
                                                                        var a = 10
                                                                        console.log(x) now here we not allocate any memmory to here if we run this show error
                                                                        error is : x is not defined 
but we have allocate to a if u try to console log a top of variable declare it show undefined
                                                                                            console.log(a)
                                                                                            var a = 10
                                                                                            console.log(a)
                                                                                            console.log(x)

                                                                                        ouput: undefined                                    script.js: 1
                                                                                        Uncaught ReffrenceError:  x is not defined          script.js: 3

so remember undefined is not equalto empty some ppls think undefined is empty bcz not taking memmory space its wrong 
its a special keyword its take memmory u asume it an place holder which kept for time between until the variable asign some other value till thate point it will store placeholder know as undefined
soppose we never put any vale inside a it is throw out whole program a value is undefined
                                                                                eg: 
                                                                                    var a;
                                                                                    console.log(a)

we try another 

     eg: 
         var a;
        console.log(a)    

        if (a === undefined){
            console.log("a is undefined)  
        }
        else {
            console.log("a is not undefined)
        }        

    ouput:
        a is undefined     

    eg: 
         var a;
        console.log(a)   

        a = 10 

        if (a === undefined){
            console.log("a is undefined)  
        }
        else {
            console.log("a is not undefined)
        } 

    ouput:
        a is not undefined       


javascript is loosly type language 
loosly type mean javascript does not attached its variable to any specific data type 
    Suppose if i  create  a put in  string in it so later on the program i can put numbers of program and also put boolien in it javascript like verry flexible in this case it is loosly type
    this is called loosly type 

   eg: 
         var a;
        console.log(a)   

        a = 10 
        console.log(a)

        a = "heloo"
        console.log(a)
    ouput:
          undefined
          10
          heloo  
 this is called loosly language also called weaklylanguage  this is not weak this is most beautiful and flexible 


    if tightly type eg c++ it all tightly tightly mean if it string type only allow sting values it not hold number or boolien 

heloo  important never do this

 a = undefined this is never do this this is a mistake and bad thing of javascript
    this is not good practice
    eg: 
            var a;
            console.log(a)   

            a = 10 
            console.log(a)

            a = "heloo"
            console.log(a)

            a = undefined
        ouput:
            undefined
            10
            heloo  
 so what is undefined?
  undefined like a placeholder which is kept inside the varriables ans its state that in the whole code that we readle that not asigned anything its made for specific purpose
