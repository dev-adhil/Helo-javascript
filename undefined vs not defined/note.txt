Yo go in the console and write you can see something
U can see there thats like big object with lot of functions and methods
this function and methods are related javascript engine and in to the global space you can this access any where in the javascript program

just like this window javascript engine also creates this key word
In the global level this this point to the window  object 

What is window?
window actually a global object which is created along with the global execution context 
whenever any javascript program run a global object is created a global execution context will created and along with the execution context at this keyword will created 

now lets discuss more about glbal object 

In the globl object in this case in case of brosers it is know as window javascript not just run in brwosers only javascript also run server and lot of devices and places not a just browser running in it 
and where ever javascript running must be a javascript engine there just like chrome its V8 mozillafirefox  there hexon firefox there also hexon allthe javascript engine resposibility is to create object
In case of brwsers it is know as windows in case of node itsknown as something else where ever you run javascript program its diffrent but there is always global object created even tho the file is empty javascript engine ceate the object 
And at the global level or at the base level in the global execution context this this equal equal o window object  this ==== window u can see its true console just type

What is global space ? 
global space is nothing but any code u write in javascriptwhich is not inside a function
    eg: 
        var a = 10
        function b(){

        }
    this is inside global space 
    but if i create any variable or function inside any function 
        
    eg :
        function b(){
            var x = 10;
        }
    function inside x is not global spce other wise everything you see on the toplevel it is the glbal space simply anything is not inside a function is global space

when ever u create any variable or functions in the global space What happends this varriable and function attached to the global object 
what was a global object it was window if we write console window there we can see we created variables and functions but inside function variables not show 

 var a = 10
        function b(){
            var x = 10;
        }

how we can access this just console.log(window.a);or console.log(window.a); or console.log(a);  this all are same memmory space window or this 
now we get 10

if we console x there we get error : x is not defined
