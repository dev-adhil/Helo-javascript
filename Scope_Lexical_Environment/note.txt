function a(){
    console.log(b)
}
var b = 10;
a();

output:
    10

-----------------------------------------------------


function a(){

    var b = 10;
    c()
    function c(){
        
    }
}
a();
console.log(b)

output:
    script5.js:11 Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
    at script5.js:11:13

first thing we chech what is the scope of this varriable b that mean where can i acess the varriable b that is scope and 
other check is b inside the scope of function c thats mean can i acess the binside c so there two way located 
1- what is the scope of varriable b 
2- is b inside scope of function ppls use diffrent ways we use same ways 

scope is directly depend on the lexical environment now lets check whats lexical environment

when ever a exicution context created a lexical environment also created lexical environment is the local memmoryalong with the lexical environmentof its parent 
lexical environment is a local memmory along with the lexical environment of its parent 
lexical mean hirarchy or in a sequence 

lets see top code c function lexicaly inside a function that mean lexical in order in hirarchy  
which is and code term assume it to be where that specific code is present physically inside the code so here c function present physically inside a() 
that means lexicaly inside a() and a() is lexicaly inside the global scope so this is know as lexical

when i say lexical environment that mean the local memmory along with lexical environment of the parrent 

lets explain more 

when execution context created you also get Reference to the lexical environment of its parent along with the memmory space along with varriable and functions this memmory space you also get reffrence of thelexical environment of the parent

      a()
[====]  ith aan parent refrence 

we can rewise 
what is lexical environment?
lexical environment is created when ever an execution context is created and lexical environment is local memmory + reffrence to the lexical environment of parent 
parent means lexical parent which mean where actually that function sits inside the code thats mean c is lexicaly inside a c lexical parent a a lexical parent gli
this whole chain of lexical environment is known as scope chain  and it defines wheather a varriable or function present inside the scope or not 
if the scope chain exuasted and varriable is not found that means not inside the scope chain

this importent scopechain 

so what was the lexical environment of a lexical environment a is local memmory of a along with the lexical environmentof the parent parent was global so local memmory + lexical environment of parrent
