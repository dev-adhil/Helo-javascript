"let & const declarations are Hoisted"  this are temporal dead zone for the time be
this two are comparing verry deffrent in var declaration 

console.log(b)
let a = 10;
var b = 100

we know we want  be access b without even declaring initilising in it that happen but in javascriptvery difrently so the memmory allocated varriables and functions even before a single of code exicuted
ok thats why even before setting a value of 100 in to beven declaring a variable bwe can access like this and we dont get any error even fact we get special
palceholder undefined isntit that was Hoisting we know that

console.log(a)
let a = 10;
var b = 100

now we get error
    output
        Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
    at script6.js:2:13

this error telling u can only access this a after u have insializesome value to the variable a so tha mean we do consolelog after some time we put in to the value thatwe are able to ace it 
but how to know whether the varriable hoisted or not 

let a = 10;
console.log(a)
var b = 100

output :
    10
